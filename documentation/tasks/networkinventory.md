# Purpose

A network inventory task aims to retrieve exhaustive informations from
SNMP-compatible devices, such as network devices or printers, already part of
the list of known assets.

This task can only be performed on devices already part of the list of known
assets, either as a result of a previous [network discovery
task](networkdiscovery.html), or manually created, with proper SNMP
credentials.
